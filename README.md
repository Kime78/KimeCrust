# KimeCrust
KimeCrust is an experimental program for me to mess around with more advanced OpenGL. The current goal of KimeCrust is to make it a Minecraft clone as close as possible, the future goal of KimeCrust is a 3D Voxel GameMaker of some sort.

Planned Minecraft features: 
* Multiplayer
* Inventory
* Crafting
* Modding

Planned engine features:
* A 3D 32*32 voxel modeling tool
* Easy networking implementation
* General ease of gamemaking
